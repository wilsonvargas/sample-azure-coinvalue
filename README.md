# Xamarin and Azure Function Sample: Coin Value

Build Status: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/37567yp4tev3dl6i?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wilsonvargas/sample-azure-coinvalue)

This sample shows two Azure Functions:

- A **Timer Triggered** function used to save bitcoin value every hour to an Azure Table
- An **HTTP Triggered** function used to get the current bitcoin value as well as the current trend (up, flat, down) calculated over the last 10 samples.

In addition you will find a Xamarin application for Android and for Windows Universal (UWP) connecting to the HTTP Triggered function and displaying the result. An iOS application is in the works.
